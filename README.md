## 📝 About the Project

As part of my internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**, I developed a full-stack **Live Chat Application** using the MERN stack, combined with **Socket.IO** for real-time communication. This platform enables multiple users to join a chat room, send and receive messages instantly, and interact with a clean, responsive user interface.

The project enhances communication efficiency and demonstrates real-time web capabilities.
